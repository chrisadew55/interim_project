### Project brief
I worked in a group with 4 other people and using our combined knowledge of SQL, Python, and data analytics, our brief was to investigate and answer the following questions on the AdventureWorks dataset: 

1. What are the regional sales in the best performing country?
2. What is the relationship between annual leave taken and bonus?
3. What is the relationship between Country and Revenue?
4. What is the relationship between sick leave and Job Title (PersonType)?
5. What is the relationship between store trading duration and revenue?
6. What is the relationship between the size of the stores, number of employees and revenue?

Question 5 was the question I was tasked with answering.

### Data sources
The primary dataset used for this analysis: The AdventureWorks2019 demo database.

### Tools and concepts used
- T-SQL (SQL Server)
- Python
- Selecting columns from a table
- Filtering rows and grouping data
- Using aggregate functions
- Performing calculations on groups of rows
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn

### Findings
The results for Q5 can be summarized as follows:
1. No correlation between trading duration and revenue
2. The lowest average revenue occurred in 1973
3. The highest average revenue occurred in 1999 (primarily Mountain bikes)
