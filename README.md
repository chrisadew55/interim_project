### Project brief
I worked in a group with 4 other people to answer a set of questions using the AdventureWorks dataset, using our combined knowledge of SQL, Python, and data analytics to investigate and answer the following questions: 

1. What are the regional sales in the best performing country?
2. What is the relationship between annual leave taken and bonus?
3. What is the relationship between Country and Revenue?
4. What is the relationship between sick leave and Job Title (PersonType)?
5. What is the relationship between store trading duration and revenue?
6. What is the relationship between the size of the stores, number of employees and revenue?

Question 5 was the question I was tasked with answering.

### Data sources
The primary dataset used for this analysis: The AdventureWorks2019 demo database.

### Tools and concepts used
- SQL (SQL Server)
- Python
- Selecting columns from a table
- Filtering rows and grouping data
- Using aggregate functions
- Performing calculations on groups of rows
- Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib 

### Findings
The results can be summarized as follows:
1. No correlation between trading duration and revenue
2. The lowest average revenue occurred in 1973
3. The highest average revenue occurred in 1999 (primarily Mountain bikes)
