### Project brief
Worked in a group of 5 people to answer a set of questions using the AdventureWorks dataset, using our combined knowledge of SQL, Python, and data analytics to investigate and answer the following questions: 

- What are the regional sales in the best performing country?
- What is the relationship between annual leave taken and bonus?
- What is the relationship between Country and Revenue?
- What is the relationship between sick leave and Job Title (PersonType)?
- What is the relationship between store trading duration and revenue?
- What is the relationship between the size of the stores, number of employees and revenue?

Question 5 was the question I was tasked with answering.

### Data sources
The primary dataset used for this analysis: The AdventureWorks2019 demo database.

### Tools and concepts used
- SQL (SQL Server)
- Python
- Selecting columns from a table
- Filtering rows and grouping data
- Using aggregate functions
- Performing calculations on groups of rows
- Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib 

### Findings
The results can be summarized as follows:
1. No correlation between trading duration and revenue
2. The lowest average revenue occurred in 1973
3. The highest average revenue occurred in 1999 (primarily Mountain bikes)
